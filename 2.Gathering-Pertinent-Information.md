# Need statement:-
## Box transfer machine:
### Many companies are looking for a solution to transfer the boxes with different sizes ,periodically from one point to another.
**INTRODUCTION :-**
The box moving or shifting set up has a simple mechanism, operated with crank and links arrangement. As by the electric motor rotary motion is converted into the To and Fro motion of the linkages, it takes very simple. The rotary motion is converted in to linear motion by the crank and mechanical linkages arrangement. The conveyor system is either continuous movement or if the time delay is to be produced there will be definite requirement of software programming which will be costly. So a basic module of moving packages is designed with time delay which can be used to do alterations if required in the package or move the package for any other purpose. This invention relates to improvements in transfer and conveying devices, and it relates particularly to devices for transferring set-up cardboard boxes from a box folding or forming machine to the operator of a semi-automatic box wrapping machine. A great many manufacturers of fancy wrapped or covered cardboard boxes used for packaging candies, cakes and other confections, cosmetics and other articles are equipped computer-aided technologies [CAD, CAM]), to control industrial machinery and processes, reducing the need for human intervention. In the scope of industrialization, automation is a step beyond mechanization. Whereas mechanization provided human operators with machinery to assist them with the muscular requirements of work, automation greatly reduces the need for human sensory and mental requirements as well. Processes and systems can also be automated. Automation plays an increasingly important role in the world economy and in daily experience. Engineers strive to combine automated devices with mathematical and organizational tools to create complex systems for a rapidly expanding range of applications and human activities.

**CONCEPT OF THE BOX TRANSPORT MECHANISM :-**
1) This is mainly used for transporting (moving/shifting) boxes automatically.
2) It is driven through a DC motor and is powered through the main battery supply.

**PRINCIPLE:-** The principle of box moving is to change circulatory motion or cycling motion of the DC motor into translator motion with the help of levers and linkages through metal connecting rods.

**APPLICATION:-**
1) Can use this mechanism in medical production fields.
2) It also can be used in bottle filling process.
3) Can use this mechanism in cool drinks production.

**ADVANTAGES:-**
1) Lubricants not required.
2) Simple to construct.
3) Low speed motor is sufficient.
4) Easy maintenance.
5) Less skilled operator is sufficient.
6) Noise of operation is reduced.

**CONSTRUCTION:-**

**ADVANTAGES**
  1) Replacing human operators in tedious tasks.
2) Replacing humans in tasks that should be done in dangerous environments (i.e. fire, space, volcanoes, nuclear
facilities, underwater, etc.)
3) Making tasks that are beyond the human capabilities such as handling too heavy loads, too large objects, too hot
or too cold substances or the requirement to make things too fast or too slow.
4) Economy improvement. Sometimes and some kinds of automation implies improves in economy of enterprises,
society or most of humankind. For example, when an enterprise that has invested in automation technology
recovers its investment; when a state or country increases its income due to automation like Germany or Japan
in the 20th Century or when the humankind can use the internet which in turn use satellites and other automated
engines.

**DISADVANTAGES:-**

1) Technology limits. Current technology is unable to automate all the desired tasks.
2) Unpredictable development costs. The research and development cost of automating a process is difficult to
predict accurately beforehand. Since this cost can have a large impact on profitability, it's possible to finish
automating a process only to
3) Discover that there's no economic advantage in doing so.
4) Initial costs are relatively high. The automation of a new product required a huge initial investment in
comparison with the unit cost of the product, although the cost of automation is spread in many product batches.
