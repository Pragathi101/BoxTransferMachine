Volume of box(V):
V = 0.512 cm^3

The material used for box is wood.
Density of wood(D) = 1 gm/cm^3
Mass of box(M):
M = Volume x Density
M = 0.512 cm^3 x 1 gm/cm^3
M = 0.512 gm

Coefficient of friction between box(wooden) and conveyor(rubber) = 0.5
COF = 0.5
Acceleration due to gravity(g) = 9.8 m/s^2
Force()F):
F = Mass x COF x g
F = 0.512 x 0.5 x 9.8
F = 2.5088 N

Torque(T):
T = FD/3n
F = Force
D = Diameter of pulley(0.05)
n = Drive efficiency(0.9)
T = (2.5088 x 0.05)/2 x 0.9
T = 0.06969 Nm
Torque(in kg cm) = 0.06969 x 100/9.8
                 = 0.7111 kg cm

Factor of safety(FOS) = 1.5
Total Torque(TT)
TT = Torque x FOS
TT = 0.711 x 1.5
TT = 1.0665 ~ 1.2 kg cm
 * Therefore a DC motor of 12V 100rpm is required.
